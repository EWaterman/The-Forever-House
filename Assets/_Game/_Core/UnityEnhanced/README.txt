This folder contains game agnostic enhancements to Unity and C# libraries. One day I intend to package this all up together so that future projects can simply import it, but for now they live in an assembly def here under the "UnityEnhanced" namespace.

Not all of these improvements are originally made by me. Below are the original sources for each:

ExtendedButtons: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/extended-buttons-152732
ScriptableObjectDropdown: https://github.com/ATHellboy/ScriptableObjectDropdown
